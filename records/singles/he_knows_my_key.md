## He Knows My Key (Is Always In the Mailbox) - [Vivian Copeland](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1394833-Vivian-Copeland)

I first heard this song on Spotify on an album called [UNDERGROUND OLDIES: VOLUME III](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Underground-Oldies-Volume-3/release/8531724) which is, unfortunately, no longer on Spotify.  You can find the song, however, on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/791FI_QKOcc).  The song is credited to Ray Dahrouge and Billy Terrell and was released as a single on [D'Oro records](https://www.discogs.com/label/144318-DOro-Records).  

I first heard this song while I was making dinner one night.  I had Spotify on the computer running through a set of speakers in the kitchen when I was washing some dishes and the song caught my attention.  It starts with a good horn part - which I always enjoy.  Then as I listened to the lyrics, about a woman who has a boyfriend that "takes all my love for granted" but she "can't help it if I love him like I do" so she makes sure that her key is always waiting for him in the mailbox so he can let himself in at night whenever he feels like it.  He treats her like crap, but she feels "someday he'll want to settle down."  So, the tale the song is telling is kind of horrible - about a woman who doesn't have enough self-respect to ditch this asshole, but I really love this song.  All of the recordings I've heard by Vivian Copeland have horn parts that sound so much like the Memphis Horns that I wouldn't be surprised if her backing band was the horn section on her recordings.

Vivian Copeland also recorded some other songs for D'Oro like "Chaos (In My Heart)," "Oh No Not My Baby," and "I Don't Care" as well as "I don't Care What He's Done (In The Past)" for Mala Records.  I don't know much about her, but all of these records seem to have been released between 1966 and 1971.

Vivian Copeland will be an artist I look for whenever I go to used record stores from now on.
