Mr. Bond.  This is your neighbor Glen from the townhouse next door.  Everything has been going pretty well here.  I've been bringing in your newspaper.  My son mowed the lawn in your back garden like you asked and your house is pretty good.  Yeah, pretty good.  Anyway, I'm just calling to let you know that my daughter, you remember my daughter Melissa - yeah, she's a good kid.  Well, she accidentally kicked her soccer ball into the drivers side window on your car - you know the Astin Martin you left it out in your driveway.  Well, anyway, I'm not sure what happened, but the soccer ball broke the drivers side window and I don't know what it hit in your car, but the roof of the car flew off and the passenger seat shot about 20 feet up into the air.  when the roof of the car came down it landed on the hood and left a big dent, but when the passenger seat came back down, well, it landed back in your car and I'm not sure what it did, but a bunch of spikes came out of the back of the car and got all over the street.  You know Mrs. Bellamy that lives about two houses down from yours?  Well, she drove over some of the spikes and they completely ruined tires.  Anyway, she was pretty angry about it so she called the police.  When the police got heree one of the officers decidet to check trunk so he flipped a switch on the dashboard but instead of opening the trunk, some kind of machine gun behind the headlights shot a bunch of holes in your garage door.  Anyway, they towed your car away.  They said that they would let you know whats up, but I thought I would just call and say that Melissa is very, very sorry about breaking the window on your car.  I hope you're having a good time on your trip to Russia and we'll see you when you get back.  Bye.
