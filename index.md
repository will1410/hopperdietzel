### Giddyup Do-nut - [Don Bowman](https://www.discogs.com/Don-Bowman-Giddyup-Do-Nut-/master/1668153)

I first encountered this song on the [November 18, 2007, episode of The Doctor Demento Show](http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo.pl?drd07.1118.html) which you can stream at [his website](https://www.drdemento.com/online.html?c=2007&s=s) for $3.00.  The song was written by Don Bowman, Noel Confer, Red Sovine, and Tommy Hill and it's a parody of "Giddy Up Go" by Red Sovine.

I first heard this song when my family and I lived in a mobile home outside of Moscow, Idaho.  I had recorded this episode of The Doctor Demento Show from an online radio station and I had it running in the background while I was doing some work and my wife came in and started talking to me and she said something along the lines of "What the hell is this?"  The song tells the story of a loser that wins a doughnut truck in a poker game and generally makes fun of Red Sovine's song "Giddy Up Go" but twists a lot of the expectations that anyone who has listened to a Red Sovine song would have.  The phrase "Yippee.  Big deal" has become a byword in our house for *I know you're excited about this but I really don't give a shit.*  I love this song because it's just totally silly.  It is an outstanding parody of the country truck-driving songs that Red Sovine made popular in the 1960s and 1970s.

Don Bowman was the 1960s-1970s country music equivalent of "Weird" Al Yankovic.  He recorded several singles and 11 albums of goofy country music songs and he worked as a DJ in Branson, Missouri.  Unfortunately, though, Bowman's life didn't end well.  In 2001 he attempted to commit suicide and the suicide attempt left him paralyzed.  He then ended up spending the last 12 years of his life in a nursing home until he died of cancer.  

Don Bowman has a few albums available on Spotify and is well worth seeking out.

### He Knows My Key (Is Always In the Mailbox) - [Vivian Copeland](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1394833-Vivian-Copeland)

I first encountered this song on Spotify on an album called [UNDERGROUND OLDIES: VOLUME III](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Underground-Oldies-Volume-3/release/8531724) which is, unfortunately, no longer on Spotify.  You can find the song, however, on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/791FI_QKOcc).  The song is credited to Ray Dahrouge and Billy Terrell and was released as a single on [D'Oro records](https://www.discogs.com/label/144318-DOro-Records).  

I first heard this song while I was making dinner one night.  I had Spotify on the computer running through a set of speakers in the kitchen when I was washing some dishes and the song caught my attention.  It starts with a good horn part - which I always enjoy.  Then as I listened to the lyrics, about a woman who has a boyfriend that "takes all my love for granted" but she "can't help it if I love him like I do" so she makes sure that her key is always waiting for him in the mailbox so he can let himself in at night whenever he feels like it.  He treats her like crap, but she feels "someday he'll want to settle down."  So, the tale the song is telling is kind of horrible - about a woman who doesn't have enough self-respect to ditch this asshole, but I really love this song.  All of the recordings I've heard by Vivian Copeland have horn parts that sound so much like the Memphis Horns that I wouldn't be surprised if her backing band was the horn section on her recordings.

Vivian Copeland also recorded some other songs for D'Oro like "Chaos (In My Heart)," "Oh No Not My Baby," and "I Don't Care" as well as "I don't Care What He's Done (In The Past)" for Mala Records.  I don't know much about her, but all of these records seem to have been released between 1966 and 1971.

Vivian Copeland will be an artist I look for whenever I go to used record stores from now on.
